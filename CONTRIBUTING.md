## How to Contribute

We welcome both **new mini-project ideas** and contributions to **existing issues**. Hereâ€™s how to start:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Forking will create a copy of this repo under your GitHub account where you can safely make changes.

ðŸ“Ž [Click here to fork](https://github.com/arya2004/beginner-python-mini-projects-hacktoberfest-2025)

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/beginner-python-mini-projects-hacktoberfest-2025.git
cd beginner-python-mini-projects-hacktoberfest-2025
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub handle.

### 3. Work on Your Contribution

You can contribute in one of two ways:

#### âœ… Option A: Work on an Existing Issue

* Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/arya2004/beginner-python-mini-projects-hacktoberfest-2025/issues) tab.
* Find an open issue that interests you.
* Comment with `I'd like to work on this.` and wait to be assigned.
* Once assigned, start working and follow the folder format described below.

#### ðŸ’¡ Option B: Add Your Own Mini Project

* Come up with a creative beginner-friendly Python project.
* Create a new folder in `src/` using this format:

  ```
  src/yourgithubusername-project-title/
  ```

Example:

```
src/janedoe-weather-app/
```

Inside that folder, include:

* Your `.py` files
* A `README.md` file with setup and usage instructions
* Optional: `requirements.txt` for dependencies

### 4. Create a Pull Request

Once your project is complete and tested:

1. Stage and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add janedoe-weather-app mini project"
   ```

2. Push to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Go to your GitHub repo and click on **Compare & pull request**.

In your PR description:

* Mention whether this is a new project or tied to an existing issue.
* Briefly describe what the project does and any special features.

## Contribution Guidelines

### âœ… Project Format

All submissions must follow this directory format:

```
src/
  yourgithubusername-projectname/
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ (any other files like images, helpers, etc.)
    â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt (if needed)
```

Do **not** place files directly inside `src/`. Always use your own uniquely named folder.

### âœ… Code Quality

* Keep code beginner-friendly and well-commented.
* Use meaningful variable and function names.
* Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

### âœ… Documentation

Each project must include a `README.md` with:

* Project title and brief description
* Steps to run it locally
* Any required dependencies (or include a `requirements.txt`)
* Screenshots or demo (optional, but appreciated!)

## Pull Request Review Process

Once you submit a pull request:

1. A maintainer will review your PR for structure, clarity, and functionality.
2. You may receive comments or change requestsâ€”please respond and push updates.
3. Once everything looks good, your PR will be merged into the repo.

We try to review PRs quickly, especially during Hacktoberfest, but please be patient.
