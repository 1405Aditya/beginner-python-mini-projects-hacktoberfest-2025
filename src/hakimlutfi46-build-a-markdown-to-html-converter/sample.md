# My Project Documentation

This is a test of the _advanced features_ of the converter.

## Main Goals

1. Ensure code blocks are handled correctly.
2. Support ordered lists for step-by-step guides.
3. Make images semantically better with **figure tags**.

```python
# A simple function
def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

This is an important diagram for our architecture.
