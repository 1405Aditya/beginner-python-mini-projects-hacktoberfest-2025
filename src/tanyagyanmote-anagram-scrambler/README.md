# Anagram Scrambler (CLI)

A beginner-friendly Python mini-game: guess the original word from its scrambled version.  
Includes hints, reshuffle, scoring, and a small built-in wordlist.

## Features
- Randomly selects a word and scrambles it (always a valid anagram).
- Commands: `hint`, `shuffle`, `skip`, `quit`.
- Simple scoring (+2 correct, -1 skip).
- No external dependencies.

## Run
```bash
python main.py
