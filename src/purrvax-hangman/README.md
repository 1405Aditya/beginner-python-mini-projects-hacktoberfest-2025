# Hangman Game

## Description
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python.  
The computer selects a random word, and you try to guess it one letter at a time.  
Each incorrect guess brings you closer to losing, so choose wisely!  
Guess all letters correctly before running out of tries to win the game.

## How to Play
- The game shows blanks for each letter in the word.  
- Enter **one letter at a time** as your guess.  
- Correct guesses reveal the letter(s) in the word.  
- Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining tries.  
- The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of tries.
