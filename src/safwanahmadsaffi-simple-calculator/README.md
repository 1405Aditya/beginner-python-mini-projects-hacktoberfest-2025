# safwanahmadsaffi-simple-calculator

Simple calculator CLI project written in Python. Provides basic arithmetic operations and a small interactive CLI.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3. Install dependencies (none required for core functionality). If you want to install extras:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the interactive calculator:

   python main.py

You can also import `calculator.py` and use its functions in your own code.

## Files

- `main.py` — small CLI that uses `calculator.py`.
- `requirements.txt` — optional dependencies (empty by default).
