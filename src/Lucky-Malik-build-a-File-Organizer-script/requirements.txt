# reaquirmenetx.txt

This project (organizer.py) uses only Python standard library modules and therefore has no runtime external dependencies.

Detected standard library imports:
- os
- shutil
- logging

No third-party packages are required to run the script on a system with Python 3.6+.

Optional development / testing packages you may want to install:
- pytest    # for running tests
- black     # for code formatting
- mypy      # for optional static type checking

To install optional dev packages (example):
    pip install pytest black mypy

If you expect to add functionality that uses external libraries, update this file (or the real `requirements.txt`) with the package names and versions.
