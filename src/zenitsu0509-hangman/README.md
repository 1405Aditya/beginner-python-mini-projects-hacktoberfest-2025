# Hangman (Beginner-Friendly)

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python.
The player tries to guess the secret word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to losing. The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

## Features

- Category-based random words (animals, fruits, colors)
- ASCII gallows graphics
- Clean, readable code with small functions

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- No external dependencies

## How to Run

```bash
# From the repository root
python src/zenitsu0509-hangman/main.py
```

Optional arguments:

```bash
python src/zenitsu0509-hangman/main.py --word fruits       # pick a category
python src/zenitsu0509-hangman/main.py --max-mistakes 8    # change difficulty
```

## Project Structure

```text
src/zenitsu0509-hangman/
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.py      # game logic + CLI
  â””â”€â”€ README.md    # this file
```

## Contributing / Learning

- Read through `main.py` â€” itâ€™s organized for clarity.
- Good beginner exercises:
  - Add a hint feature (reveal one random letter)
  - Track and display remaining letters not yet guessed
  - Add more categories or load words from a file

Enjoy playing and hacking on it! ðŸŽ‰
